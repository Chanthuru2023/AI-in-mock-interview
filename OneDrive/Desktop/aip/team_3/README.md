# Artificial Intelligence Powered Mock Interview Tool

## Project Overview
The AI Mock Interview Tool utilizes advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **emotion recognition** algorithms to analyze candidates’ interview performances. Users receive real-time feedback on various aspects such as **eye movement**, **tone**, **clarity**, and **confidence levels**. The tool aims to improve the candidate’s interview experience and provide recruiters with insightful data for more informed hiring decisions.

## Features
- **User Interface (UI)**: Simple and user-friendly interface to start, pause, and stop mock interviews, along with a dashboard displaying post-interview analysis.
- **NLP & Emotion Recognition**: Transcription of candidate responses and analysis of speech content, clarity, and tone for better feedback.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides a detailed report on soft skills, including eye contact, body language, and confidence levels.
- **Recording Features**: Allows video/audio recording during the mock interview for later review.
- **Support for Multiple Devices**: Works across desktop, mobile, and tablet platforms.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLTK, SpaCy, or similar
- **Emotion Recognition**: OpenCV, Dlib, or other video processing libraries
- **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase / SQL
- **Deployment**: Docker, Heroku (or any cloud-based service)
